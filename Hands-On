Execution Part
--------------
To start minikube
        minikube start --driver=virtualbox (make sure Oracle VB in open state)

Basic Commands:
* To check the list of nodes
        kubectl get nodes
* To view the dashboard
        minikube dashboard   //will navigate to the default browser to view the content
        kubec
* Adding an app from dashboard
        Click on + on top right corner.
        Select "Create from Form"
        App-Name        : nginx-app
        Container image : nginx
        No of Pods      : 2
        Click on Deploy

* To view the deployed pods/available pods
        kubectl get pods
        
Managing the Pods:
------------------

In general, in kubernetes cluster we will deal with either Single-node or multi-node.
Eg:     When we are going to deal with more than 2 systems/machines we can call it as multinode
        Here we dealt with only one-node with the help of VirtualBox, it is called as singlenode.
NOTE: In general multi node will be acceptable, whereas single node is not at all required for production environments only for practice perpose.

What is a POD?
* A POD is a collection of Container(s) or Dependency Containers. Volumes.
* In general 1 Pod - 1 Container is recommended. (We can use dependency container but not for mandate)
* We can scale-up and scale-down the pods, it is called as Replica-Sets
* If we create 2 PODS, the content which is available in POD-1 will have the save in POD-2 too.
* Even replications/replicaset is also managed by minikube, by mentioning all in the app deployment file (which is .yml or yaml)
* If a POD goes down, the replicaset will create another POD
* Depends on the Replicaset count which was provided in the deployment file, all will be managable.
All these tasks will be managable by Kubernetes, by that way we are going to manage the PODS.
